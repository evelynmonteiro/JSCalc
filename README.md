## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

To solve this challenge I decided to include SASS in the stack as a way to learn how to use this tool. While developing the project in parallel, I learned and implemented the main features of SASS. I also wanted to practice a little more of my programming logic with Javascript.

### Continued development

Now my biggest goal will be to write the codes in Javascript in a better way, probably following some programming paradigm like OOP or functional. And also learn to use scss which is another SASS syntax.
